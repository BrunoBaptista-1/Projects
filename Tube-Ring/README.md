Due to the vast amount of adapters that can be attached to a telescope via a standardized "finder shoe"/ "finder base" plate, there was a need to create a removable attachment that could be used to provide a stable connection to the telescope's Optical Tube Assembly, where one could insert a plethora of attachments that used the same standard. In a specific use case, a Tube Ring was developed in order to fit an electronic focuser, for an inner diameter of 250mm.

Since I had no access to a large 3D printer, the tube ring was split into 4 sections, which is then secured by inserting threaded inserts on both sides with screws and nuts that match that lenth, ensuring a proper fit.

CAD Design:

The finder base was implemented in one of the sections, so it could allow for more attachments on the OTA. On the side, a 40mm M5 Threaded bolt is set to close the clamp mechanism, ensuring a proper fit.
