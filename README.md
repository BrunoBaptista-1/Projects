My archive of personal projects showcases some of the work that I have been developing recently. These projects have focused more on projects related to astronomy use cases, where I take advantage of 3D printing and Electronics to create these projects.

In this repo, each project is separated onto each folder, where a detailed ReadMe of each build is written on separate files, according to each project, for better cohesion.
