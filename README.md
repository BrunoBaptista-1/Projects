My archive of personal projects showcases some of the work that I have been developing recently. These projects highlight my interests, such as astronomy use cases, where I take advantage of 3D printing and Electronics to create these projects.

In this repo, each project is separated onto each folder, where a detailed ReadMe of each build is written on separate files, according to each project, for better cohesion.


Future Project Highlights:
- Autonomous Drone through ArduPilot
- Autonomous/Remotely Controlled Submarine through ArduSub
- Using Meshtastic Network to develop an off-grid pet tracker that does not require any monthly subscriptions
- Motorized Antenna for Satellite tracking  w/ RTL-SDR and Raspberry Pi
- Attempting Tripoli L1 Rocketry Certification
