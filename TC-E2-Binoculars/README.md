There is a common misconception in the amateur world of astronomy, which generally compares the quality of your rig with how far, in terms of magnification, you can observe. 
However, in visual astronomy, there is so much that the unaided eye can observe, and a set of low-power binoculars can extend your viewing experience by better viewing objects that have higher magnitudes of brightness (dimmer objects), that were once difficult to the unaided eye. This works wonders when viewing wide constellations, the Milky Way, or just plain stargazing in general.

With a set of old 2x Teleconverters from an old camera lying around, it is possible to create a wide FOV, low-powered set of binoculars, that can nearly double the amount of targets that you can observe, in comparison with the unaided eye. All that's left is to develop a case in CAD Software that turns both Teleconverters into a set of Binoculars. 

**Materials**
- TC-E2 2x Teleconverter (2x)
- Access to 3D printer
- M4 Screw
- M4 Nut
- Camera Strap
- PLA-CF Filament
